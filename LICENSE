Muk7tm's Docs License (No Rebrand / No Repurpose)
Version 1.0 - 2026-02-15

Copyright (c) 2026 Muk7tm

This is a source-available license. It is not an OSI "open source" license.

1. Definitions
   - "Project" means Muk7tm's Docs: this repository, its documentation, theme, and build files.
   - "You" means any person or entity using the Project.

2. Permission
   You may:
   - View, use, and run the Project for personal or internal use.
   - Fork the repository for the purpose of contributing improvements back upstream.
   - Publish your fork ONLY if it follows Section 3 (Restrictions) and keeps this LICENSE.

3. Restrictions (what you may not do)
   3.1 No rebranding / name changes
       You may not change the Project name ("Muk7tm's Docs"), remove Muk7tm attribution, or present
       a modified version as your own documentation brand.

   3.2 No repurposing / subject changes
       You may not repurpose the Project to document a different person, organization, or unrelated
       set of projects. The Project must remain a documentation hub for Muk7tm's projects.

   3.3 Only improvements (no destructive edits)
       You may not remove large parts of the docs, change the meaning/subject, or intentionally
       degrade the content. Changes must be additive or corrective (fixes, updates, UI improvements,
       clearer wording, better structure) while keeping the same purpose.

4. Distribution Requirements
   If you publish a fork or derivative:
   - Keep the Project name and attribution to Muk7tm intact.
   - Keep this LICENSE file.
   - Clearly label it as an "Unofficial fork" and link back to the original repository.

5. No Trademark Rights
   Except for the limited permission above to keep the original name for allowed forks, this license
   does not grant trademark rights to any names or branding associated with Muk7tm.

6. Termination
   If you violate this license, your permissions end automatically.

7. Disclaimer
   THE PROJECT IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR
   COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY.
